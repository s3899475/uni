====== Timed Assessment 2 ======

30 subnets - 2^{5}

==== Q10 ====
a)
The IP and MAC address pairs will be:
Host 1:
172.168.10.1
A0.B0.11.22.33.A0
This is because the ARP request is sent to the network address, and so it will be flooded to all hosts in the network. When Host 2 receives this ARP message it will save the IP and MAC address in its ARP cache. The response will only be send back to Host 1.

b)
The sender of the ARP request to Host 4 will be router 2, because the router will relay the ARP request.

c)
Host 3:
172.168.10.1
A0.B0.AA.BB.CC.99
Host 4:
172.168.10.1
A0.B0.66.77.88.99

Host 3 will receive the relayed  ARP request from router 1 and save its IP and MAC address in its ARP cache. The IP address will be that of Host 1 but the MAC address with be that of Router 1, because that is the interface that it must send data to for it to get to Host 1
Host 4 will receive the relayed ARP request from Router 2, and router 2 will change the request to have its MAC address, but the IP address of Host 1
