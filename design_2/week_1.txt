===== 1) Electronic Design Process =====
how to progress from idea to outcome

=== Steps: ===
* Specification of Requirements
* Circuit Design
* Prototype Investigations
* PCB Layout
* Testing
* Final Product

=== Specification of Requirements ===
* input & output: power and signals
* temperature
* frequencies
* dimensions
* weight

can have different circuit typologies that may be valid

=== Circuit Design ===
* Block diagram: break circuit into parts
* Schematic capture
* Simulation
* Component selection (price vs quality)

=== Prototype Investigations ===
* Explore what is not known about the circuit

=== PCB layout ===
* Placement & routing
* make sure it matches with circuit diagram
* solder components - soldering tutorial on canvas
	* surface mount devices (SMD) first
	* smallest to biggest (usually)
	* then do through-hole components

=== Testing & Verification ===
* use multimeter & eyes to check over circuit for shorts
* Do initial power on test - if output is too high turn off immediately!
* Test functionality incrementally
* more to come in future lectures

=== Then release to customers! ===
