===== 1) PCB Process Flow =====

=== PCB Terminology: ===
* Pad: place to solder a SMD device or thru-hole
* track: copper path that connects components (basically wire)
* Via: hold in board with connection between layers
* Soldermask: a layer of insulating lacquer that covers the rest of the board
* Silkscreen (overlay): letters printed on the final board

=== Component packages (types) ===
* Through-hole
	* put solder in hole to hold wire and connect
	* solder on opposite side to component
* SMD/SMT (surface mount device/technology)
	* Soldered on the face of the board
	* smaller and denser than through hole
	* Some common form factors:
		* 0805 (means 0.08"x0.05")
		* 1206
		* 1210
	* harder to solder - especially if small!

=== PCB Tradeoffs ===

== pros: ==
* Performance/Reliability
* Space-savings
* Simple to manufacture
* More immune to movement

== cons: ==
* Permanence - hard to hot swap
* Lead-time
* Compatibility

=== PCB Process flow - design steps ===
Stages
Designer:
* Schematic
* Layout
* Routing
* CAM Gerber output - send to manufacturer
Production
* DFM
* Production
* Assembly (can be DIY)
