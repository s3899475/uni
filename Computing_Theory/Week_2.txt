marking

platapus game
5 basic tournaments of 268 random machines
Tournament requires 36,046 because every machine plays every other machine, only permutations, but a machine can play itself
average time taken was 21.4s

1 plays n games
2 plays n-1 games
3 plays n-2 games
so that they don't have to do the same mactches
n(n+1)/2 total

why 268 machines?
find a machine that beats everybody else
any colours, any animals, any tree or not
each space has 2 colours, 4 animals, 2 tree states
2*4*2 = 16
7 spaces
16^7
