====== Week 4 ======
game idea:
make a turing machine for a language
simplified?
input of strings
like spacechem

===== Tutorial =====
==== Turing Machines ====
=== Church-Turing thesis ===
Anything that can be done by and algorithmic process can be done by a turing machine
	so "computable" means "can be done via a turing machine"
=== Other stuff ===
There are problems which are undecidable (or non-computable)
Universality: There is a universal turing machine which can simulate any turning machine (programmable machines)
=== Definition of turning machines ===
based on observation of human calculation processes
* Input is a string
* output is yes or no*
* string is processed as dictated by the machine
* memory is the current machine state + tape (infinitely long)
* Output is based on the last state reached*

*turing machines have different modes of output
{{./pasted_image.png}}
tape is initially the input string
starts on the first character

=== Formal Definition ===
6-tuple
* Q - finite set of states
* Î£ - finite alphabet
Only halt when there is no transition defined

== 2 modes of output ==
* Recognise languages (yes or no)
* Compute functions (tape as output)

For each nondeterministic turing machine there is a deterministic machine
For any turing machine ,there is a machine that uses at most 2 symbols + blank
For any turing machine ,there is a machine that uses at most 2 states, usines more symbols
A turing machine can be represented as a string
