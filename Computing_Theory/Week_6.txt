==== Converting NFAs to DFAs ====
JFLAP can convert NFA to DFA
There is a difference between a Deterministic and Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata

Can find multiple DFAs for a NFA - equivalent machines

What DFAs can's do:
* Recognise context-free languages
* context-sensitive languages
* ?

NFA key issues
conains λ
may contain more than one transition for a given state and input

Solutions
compute λ closure
	consider abc as λ* a λ* b λ* c λ*

fold lambda

=== e.g. 2 ===
at least one must be afinal state for combined to be a final state

=== Steps: ===
* Start with λ closure for each state
* Generate t table
* Initial state of DFA is the λ closure of initial state in NFA
* Construct DFA
	* Keep adding states until all transitions are to existing states

DFA may be exponentially larger!!
n -> 2^{n} states in DFA max

==== Pumping Lemma ====
Reasoning about what DFAs can't do
property of regular languages

DFAs have bounded memory - known before it is run
any string over a certain length with contain repeated sections - some sequences of states will be repeated

For any string w ∈ L(M) with |w| ≥ [[#states]] in M, there is a cycle
=== Definintion ===
Let L be any regular language
Then there is a DFA M such that L = L(M)
Let the number of states in M be n
Consider w ∈ L(M) with |w| ≥ n, so w=a1a2a3...anan+1
{{./pasted_image006.png}}
cannot avoid a cycle with a string of length n or above
basically same as pidgeon hole principle

|xy| ≤ n

For any regular language L, there is n ≥ 1 such that for any w ∈ L with |w| ≥ n, there exist x, y, z such that xyz and:
* |xy| ≤ n
* y ! = λ
* x y^{i} z ∈ L for all i ≥ 0

So for any L, for some n find w = xyz ∈ L with |w| ≥ n
* If L is regular, the xz, xyz, xyyz, ... **are all in L**
* If xy^{j}z ∉ L for some j ≥ 0, then **L is not regular**
	* any example can prove this! - proof by contradiction
== not regular = there is no DFA! ==

=== Proof ===
* Assume L is regular
* Apply Pumping Lemma
* Choose string w ∈ L
