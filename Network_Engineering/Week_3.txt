====== Week 3 ======

in a switch, broadcast frames go to all ports in a vlan, axcept the sending port
unknown destination â†’ broadcast
from 1 vlan to another, frame will be dropped if there is no Layer 3 networking device (IP router)
MAC Address structure
OUI (Orginizationally Unique ID) is first 6 bytes
Logical Units are always required in Juniper Router Interface
IRB - Integrated Routeing and Bridging interface
* It is a logical Layer 3 interface

Collision domain:
* remove layer 3 and bridging devices, keep their interfaces
* Count sub-networks (each interface has a collision domain, but 2 can be in the same doimain)

MAC addresses only work in one broadcast domain

trunk ports send any VLANs
different VLANs must be in different broadcast domains
