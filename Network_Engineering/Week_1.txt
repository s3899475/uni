===== Part 1: Internet Introduction =====
GW - gateway
ISP - Internet Service Provider
ICP - Internet Content Provider

=== Service Provider Tiers: ===
Tier 1
* Server primarily as transit provider
* e.g. AT&T, Level 3, Sprint
Tier 2
* Purchase services from Tier 1
* Also provide transit for some smaller providers
* e.g. Bell Canada
Tier 3
* Re-sell services for various Tier 2 service providers to their customes
* Depend on transit service (other tiers)

IXP - Internet Exchange Point
* Allows traffic to be exchanged between ISPs

POP - Point of Presence
* Physical location where an ISP aggregates its customer connections and connects them to the internet
* ISP usually have POPs in different cities, a city may not have direct access to a content provider

SLAs - Service Level Agreements
* Contract to define traffic guarantees

Demarcation Points
* Separates the customer network and the provider network
* Also separates service provider and customer responsibilities

==== Services Building Blocks ====
* Customer Edge (CE) devices
	* end user owned and operated
	* unaware of tunneling protocols or VPN services provided by ISP
* Provider Edge (PE) Devices
	* has at least one interface connected to CE
	* gateway to VPN services of the ISP
* Provider (P) Router
	* supports bandwidth and switching requirements of the ISP

==== TCP/IP Model ====
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
* standardized method of communicating over the internet
* layered protocol structure
* each layer is responsible for a set of services and capabilities provided to the layers above and below
* Layering simplifies procedures, makes it easier to understand


==== Data Encapsulation ====
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
* TCP/IP stack adds layerd information to the application-generated data
* Encapsulation occurs in each layer as data travels from the upper layer down:
	* Application encapsulation
	* Transport encapsulation
	* IP encapsulation
	* Network interface encapsulation

===== Part 2: Layer 2 and Layer 3 Equipment Focus =====
Lot of useless stuff and marketing material in the slides, this is all that seemed important

Control and forwarding planes are separated in Junos OS routers
Routing Engine:
* Part of the Control plane
* Maintains routing and forwarding tables
* Manages the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE)
* Exception Traffic (e.g. TTL) is rate-limited in internal link between RE and PFE to protect the RE from potential DoS attacks
Packet Forwarding Engine
* uses Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding tables, provided by RE
* Implements various services such as policing, stateless firewall filtering and class of service
* Control traffic (i.e. exception traffic) is given preference when congestion exists

=== You need to commit config changes on router using 'commit' to activate them ===
=== you can then use the 'rollback n' command to go back to previous versions ===
==== Commands ====
* 'edit' == 'cd' when in conf mode
* 'up' == 'cd ..'
* 'top' == 'cd [[/']]
* 'exit' to leave config mode when at top
* 'set' == touch
* 'delete' == rm
* 'rename' == 'mv' - rename {dir} {old} to {new}
* 'replace pattern' - replace pattern {old} with {new}
* 'copy' == cp
* 'deactivate'
* 'insert' - insert term {one} before term {two}
* 'annotate' - annotae a setting

* 'commit check' - check syntax
* 'commit confirmed' - will be auto rolled back
* 'commit at 21:00:00'
* 'commit comment'
* 'show | compare' - compare changes
* 'show conf | compare rollback {number}
* 'show conf | compare {filename}'
* 'save {filename/url} - saves only current dir down by default
* 'load' - can replace. merge, override
* 'request system halt' - gracefully power off
* 'request system configuration rescue' or 'rollback rescue' - load rescue configuration

==== Interfaces ====
* Management - connects to management network
* Internal - Connects control and forwarding planes
* Network - provides media-specific network connectivity. e.g. ethernet, SONET, ATM
* Services - Provides specific capabilities for manipulating traffic before it is delivered
* Loopback - Logical interface that is always up. All Junos devices use the lo0 designation for it
