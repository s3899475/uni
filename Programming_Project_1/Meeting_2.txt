====== Meeting 2 ======

2024-03-26

Attendees:
Christopher Tait
Martin Lawrence
Timothy Wiley
Owen Griffiths

find out reason others cannot attend
* have multiple messaging channels (so that messages don't get lost)

change scope in project charter if scope is modified
need to be clear on the scope of expected work
* assessed at end of sem (have u met the scope in project charter?)

review of project charter 1st draft
may want to define more team roles in charter
* add in main contact with RMIT IMAV
	* can be a rolling job (change the designated person)

=== risk management edit ===
- main risk is the timeline of development (dependent on aerospace for hardware)
- access to equipment
 - joint collaboration
may need to reevaluate timeline

next biggest risk is hardware failure
 - equipment will probably fail, need to be ready for it

=== ros2 ===
* may want to use ros2 humble instead of ros2 iron - more supported
* ros2 doesn't have to use mavlink directly
* various methods of navigation (LiDar, GPS, Slam??)

=== IMAV team ===
try and see if you can have someone attend (in person) RMIT IMAV team
question to IMAV:
* can we have off craft compute? - does it have to be on raspberry pi or nvidia jetson
	* see what hardware IMAV can produce
* what are will the vision sensor be?
* what will the control platform be (GPS, maybe other?)

=== hardware sourcing ===
Tim has:
* Raspberry Pi 3B
* Pi 400
* logitech webcam
* noname brand webcam
* budget is up to what Tim and Simon can provide
* The Construct subscriptions
	* Ros2 basics in 5 days
* we may need to to supply sdcards

Martin action item:
- Martin to pick up Raspberry Pi's today
- source SD card (16Gb for ros install)

Owen:
* see how raspberry pi works with YOLO and a webcam
* use OpenCV for image preprocessing
	* Then pass data on to tensorflow or YOLO (YOLO is the preference as we don't have to train it)
* Get previous year's vision code from Tim - send him an email

control decision to make:
* go fully ros
* OR python interface to MAVLINK

Tim's student has simulation code for MAVLINK without ros -  can send it to us

**In the next two weeks:**
* investigate vision options
* investigate control problem (interface code - MAVLINK, ros, ardupilot, aircraft)

==== IMAV RULES ====
task 1:
flying to area - leave for the moment

task 2:
animal census
recognise zebra
find existing models (off the shelf)
 - need to do pre-processing (isolate zebras based on colour, find bounding box)
 - don't do ML vision on the whole camera image
train your own
 - generate dataset
make sure that each animal is counted individually

Tasks:
1 - go through rules rigorously
2 - ask question to Simon - ask about the difficulties/different configurations that might be used for the zebras

task 3:
dynamic imaging of animals
need to control position of the drone to get a better image of the animal

task 4:
uses ArUco tag
