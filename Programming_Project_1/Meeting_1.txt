====== Meeting 1 ======

Project Meeting 1 with mentor

Questions:
What is the objective of the project?
What software and tools can we use?
What is the existing codebase?

IMAV
 - there is an aerospace RMIT team working on it too
 - aerospace design (fixed wing or quadcopter) + software
- not just a coding challenge

project structure
- scope due end of the week
- software side of the **outside IMAV challenge**
 - look at the rules for last year
 - working with aerospace engineering
 - lots of opportunity for management
 - marks allocated to reports & documentation

Tim = more of the mentor than the client
client = Simon Watkins & associate dean of aerospace engineering (Jennifer Palmer)

client brief
aerospace team will do the design of drone 
ardupilot will be used
don't have to worry about hardware or comms
plug in to drone control via ardupilot

overall project is a combination of computer vision + autonomous control

vision: existing tools
- investigate existing tools
 - upskill in tools
 - not expected to build a full vision system

vision toolkits:
scikit-learn, tensorflow, YOLO vision, openCV

control:
ardupilot
 - ardupilot scripting
 - python or c style API?

ros (robot operating system)
 - software library for robot systems
- has offline simulation
 - has communication with ardupilot - has been done before (existing codebase)
 - ros2 would be used

GCS (ground control station) - laptop, maybe. or Raspberry Pi, can do vision processing
there is a pi on the aircraft

first deliverables:
upskilling - tests with CV/control
meeting and deciding details with IMAV team

expected 10 hrs per week - includes meetings
have to decide how to run the project - management
a unique part of the project is the integration with another student team
 - they are not the clients

group roles need to be assigned
admin
task logs
contact points
team lead
etc.

next up:
get in contact with clients + IMAV team
check out crash courses for ros2 on the construct
can send week 3 document to tim by tomorrow night to check over it
