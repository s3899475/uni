===== Boolean math in this week =====

ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit

32 general purpose 8-bit registers
	- X, Y, Z (16 bit regs, take up R26-R31)
status register - updated after all ALU operations - page 17 of datasheet + other operations
 - reset after power cycle
Flags:
* Carry - checks overflow



SPH, SPL - stack pointer

The lower 2144 Data Memory locations address the Register File, the I/O Memory, and the internal data SRAM.
The first 96 locations address the Register File and I/O Memory, and the next 2048 locations address the internal
data SRAM.


RISC? - 131 instructions

can multiply 2 8 bits to 1 16 bits reg?

ISR - interrupt - needs to be very fast, maybe better to run in assembly

literals can only be loaded into registers R16 to R31
LDI Rd, K (Load immediate, R_destination, constant u8)

start on paper or with another programming lang, then move to assembler
