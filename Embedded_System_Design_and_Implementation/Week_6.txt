timer 6 code in lecture notes
simplest timer
(1 & 8) are advanced?
apb1 - 46 MHz
timers run at twice the rate?
gpio F already configured in template code - for external RAM clocks

bunch of constants in c header - use to enable certain bits
__asm("NOP"); — inline asm

GPIO_MODER_MODEx_Msk — 0x3 shifted into position (x)
use bit flip (~) of this to clear

to set
0x01 « GPIO_MODER_MODEx_Pos
or use 0x03 to set both bits, 0x02 to set 2nd bit
