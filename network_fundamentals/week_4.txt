layer 2: data link layer

requirements for effective communication:
* syncronization - beggining and end must be recognisable
* flow control - dont overwhelm recieving station
* error control - error correction
* Addressing - identity in a LAN must must be specified
* control and data on same link - must be able to distinguish control information from data transmitted (headders)
* link management - procedures for management of exchanges are required


flow control: - stop and wait
reciever must send acknowledement for sender to send more frames
sliding window:
send window size number of frames, recv replies which frame it is up to
sender resizes window to window size
keeps some frames

efficiency is better because we can have multiple frames in transit


ingredients for error control:
* error detection
* positive acknowledement
* retrnsmission after timeout
* negative acknowledgement and retransmission

Types of ARQ (error retransmission):
* stop and wait - frame and ACK - if no ACK after timeout, frame is sent again
* Go-back-n: uses sliding window. reciever can ask sender to go back. sender can ask reciever to tell it what frame it is on, after timeout
* Selective reject: reciever can ask for a specific frame, does not discard frames after it like go-back-n does. sender can ask reciever to tell it what frame it is on, after timeout

DIFFERENT FROM TCP/UDP
unacknowledged connectiondess protocol - datagram
connection-mode service: with error checking - TCP?
acknowledged connectionless service - UDP?



hub - only sone station may transmit at a time
switch - can accomidatite simultaneous transmissions
