traffic engineering:
relationship between:
* grade of service (GoS)
* Traffic load
* Network dimensions (system capacity)

used to design effective systems with a predfined variable, eg. grade of service (e.g. 99% GoS)

==== Classical model (erlang): ====
* phone calls arrive at a rate - lambda
* calls last a certain duration - h
* specific number of channels - n

Model assumes calls will be dropped if volume is too large

traffic intensity or loading
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}

Blocking formula (blocking probability) - uses calculated traffic intensity

[[GoS]] = 1 - Blocking probability

==== Classical model (data traffic: ====
* paket arrival rate - lambda
* average packet length - L
* server
* link speed (unit / sec) - R
* average service time = L / R
