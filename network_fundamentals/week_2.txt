===== Attenuation performance of twisted pair & optical fiber =====
{{./pasted_image004.png}}


===== 1) The physical layer =====

=== Two media types: wired & wireless, guided & unguided ===
Wireless & unguided:
* WiFi
* Cellular (LTE)
* Satellite
Wired & guided:
* Ethernet
* Optical fiber

Properties of physical layer medias:
* Data rate - bps (bits per second)
* Propagation delay - time: micro seconds, usually
* Quality - measured by error rate: BER (Bit error rate) - wireless more noisy

usually physical layer does error correction

==== Twisted pair cables: ====
twisted pairs reduce signal rate, as opposed to a single wire or two untwisted wires

== Attenuation (or insertion loss) is the output signal over the input signal: ==
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
P_t = transmitted signal's power
P_r = received signal's power

decibel scale is most often used

== NEXT (Near-end crosstalk) ==
defined in terms of the amount of **signal loss** between the local transmitter and local receiver
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
where P_c is the power of the crosstalk signal

=== Aim: attenuation as low as possible & NEXT as high possible (so minimise P_c) ===

== Attenuation to crosstalk ratio (ACR) ==
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
is basically NEXT / A, because of logs

higher frequency = more attenuation (loss)

=== Cable structure: ===
* UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
* FTP - Foiled Twisted Pair
* STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
* S-FTP - Shielded Foilded Twisted Pair

Other attributes:
* Bending radius
* Allowed tension
* Weather proofing
* PoE (Power over Ethernet)
* Thickness - thicker wire will outperform thinner wire in terms of attenuation

== Different CAT standard cables use different structure ==

=== Line codes sent symbols that represent one or more bit ===
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

=== More signal levers gives faster data rate - but cable needs more bandwidth ===

===== 2) Fiber cables =====
limitation in fiber cables is usually devices at each end, because fiber has enormous bandwidth (Terahertz) and low signal loss
fiber cables usually carry infrared (wavelength is longer than visible)

=== Types: ===
* Single-mode
	* Core is so narrow (10 micrometers) that light can't bounce around
	* used with lasers for long distances (e.g. 10km)
	* single glass core, with cladding & a plastic jacket around it
* Multi-mode
	* Light can bounce (50 micrometer core)
	* Used with LEDs for cheap, shorter distance links
	* Multiple cores, each with its own cladding and jacket, all contained within a sheath
	* Bitrate is lower as signal must be slowed because of some bouncing rays taking longer to get to the end
