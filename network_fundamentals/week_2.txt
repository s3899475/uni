===== Attenuation performance of twisted pair & optical fiber =====
{{./pasted_image004.png}}


===== 1) The physical layer =====

=== Two media types: wired & wireless, guided & unguided ===
Wireless & unguided:
* WiFi
* Cellular (LTE)
* Satellite
Wired & guided:
* Ethernet
* Optical fiber

Properties of physical layer medias:
* Data rate - bps (bits per second)
* Propagation delay - time: micro seconds, usually
* Quality - measured by error rate: BER (Bit error rate) - wireless more noisy

usually physical layer does error correction

==== Twisted pair cables: ====
twisted pairs reduce signal rate, as opposed to a single wire or two untwisted wires

== Attenuation (or insertion loss) is the output signal over the input signal: ==
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
P_t = transmitted signal's power
P_r = received signal's power

decibel scale is most often used

== NEXT (Near-end crosstalk) ==
defined in terms of the amount of **signal loss** between the local transmitter and local receiver
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
where P_c is the power of the crosstalk signal

=== Aim: attenuation as low as possible & NEXT as high possible (so minimise P_c) ===

== Attenuation to crosstalk ratio (ACR) ==
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
is basically NEXT / A, because of logs

higher frequency = more attenuation (loss)

=== Cable structure: ===
* UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
* FTP - Foiled Twisted Pair
* STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
* S-FTP - Shielded Foilded Twisted Pair

Other attributes:
* Bending radius
* Allowed tension
* Weather proofing
* PoE (Power over Ethernet)
* Thickness - thicker wire will outperform thinner wire in terms of attenuation

== Different CAT standard cables use different structure ==

=== Line codes sent symbols that represent one or more bit ===
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

=== More signal levers gives faster data rate - but cable needs more bandwidth ===
{{./pasted_image002.png}}

===== 2) Fiber cables =====
limitation in fiber cables is usually devices at each end, because fiber has enormous bandwidth (Terahertz) and low signal loss
fiber cables usually carry infrared (wavelength is longer than visible)

=== Types: ===
* Single-mode
	* Core is so narrow (10 micrometers) that light can't bounce around
	* used with lasers for long distances (e.g. 10km)
	* single glass core, with cladding & a plastic jacket around it
* Multi-mode
	* Light can bounce (50 micrometer core)
	* Used with LEDs for cheap, shorter distance links
	* Multiple cores, each with its own cladding and jacket, all contained within a sheath
	* Bitrate is lower as signal must be slowed because of some bouncing rays taking longer to get to the end


===== 3) Wireless media =====
Different bands have different uses:
* radio: wide-area broadcast
* microwave - most common
* millimetre wave - 5G point to point links
* infrared/light - line of sight
6Ghz to 40Ghz:
* directional
* point-to-point
* satellite
30MHz to 6GHz:
* Omnidirectional
* Access networks (cellular, IoT, WiFi, etc
* broadcast radio

Aus: ACMA - radio spectrum authority
UE - FCC
There are a few unlicensed bands - don't have to apply or pay for them
ISM bands (Industrial Scientific Medical) - includes WiFi

Infrared:
* needs line of sight
* usually doesn't require licence


Factors affecting signal loss:
* Free space - loss with distance
* Atmospheric Absorption
* Multipath - interfering signals from reflections
* Refraction - signal bends away from receiver


== Power calculations ==
spherical power
flux: power transmitted by area
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
where P_t is the power at the source
and d is the distance from the source

Power that can be captured by an antenna:
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
A = area of antenna

Isotropic antenna:
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
when frequency * wavelength = speed of light:
{{./equation007.png?type=equation}}

== basically just inverse square law ==

=== FSPL = free space path loss ===
{{./equation008.png?type=equation}}
=== in decibels (more frequently used) ===
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}
or
{{./equation010.png?type=equation}}

== antennas do not amplify the signal, but they direct the signal, like in a torch ==
antennas can also be directed. E.g. dipole antenna (used for WiFi) signal is mostly transmitted in plane perpendicular to pole

=== Generic equation for received power: ===
{{./equation011.png?type=equation}}
where PL is the path loss (not necessarily free space path loss)
this equation is all in **decibel scale**

EIRP - Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power

==== Interference ====
* main performance limiter in wireless communication
* originated from other wireless devices
* more severe in licence free bands


===== 4) Modulation =====
Base Band - uses entire band
cannot use the whole frequency band in wireless communication as interference will occur

Band Pass - use small amount of base band
much smaller band
other users can use a different band

Some different types of modulation
{{./pasted_image005.png}}


Constellation: vector of amplitude and phase
phase is angle

denser constellation = more bits packed in each symbol
more density requires a closer distance

==== multiplexing: ====
types:
* Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
	* each device uses different frequencies (e.g. WiFi bands)
	* very common nowadays
	* requires a frequency gap between signals
	* Not very efficient bandwidth utilisation
* Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
	* Allows each user a specific amount of time
	* used in baseband communication
	* Was common in old transmission methods
* **OFDM - Orthogonal FDM**
	* Signal is designed so that the bands can be much more dense and overlap
	* More efficient than FDM
	* Used in WiFi, LTE
* Wavelength Division Multiplexing
	* Used in optical fiber, mostly
	* can be used to carry many signals on one fiber
	* signals are combined then filtered to one specific one at the end

==== Abstract Channel Model ====
{{./pasted_image006.png}}


==== Max Data Rate of a Channel ====
{{./equation012.png?type=equation}}
where B is the Bandwidth (Hz), S is the signal strength (mW or W) and N is the noise (mW or W)
