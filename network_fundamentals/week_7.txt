WAN and cellular

circuit switching (obsolete) vs packet switching
5x2 = 5 inputs 2 outputs

3 stage circuit switching switches
very complicated
really need an image

N = total number of inputs & outputs (same number of each)
n = number of inputs in one box thing

total number of crosspoints in 1st stage = N(2n-1), same number in the third stage
number in 2nd stage = (2n-1)(N/n)^2

Total number of crossbars in the switch = (2n-1)[2N + (N/n)^2]


Cellular:


geometrical area of a hexagonal cell = 1.5*r^2*sqrt(3)
area of entire network = area of cell * number of cells
number of channels per cell = total channels / reuse factor
total number of channels = number of channels per cell * number of cells

cluster frequency requse factor is the number of cells in a single cluster

total simultaneous calls (channels) = number of clusters * bandwidth of a cluster / bandwidth for a single call
number of calls supported by one cell = total number of channels / frequency reuse factor


Networks
more paths through a network enhances reliability so that if one path fails there is another option

advantages of packet switching
line efficiency is greater as a single node to node link can be dynamically shared by many packets over time
stations with different data rates can exchange packets because the network can perform data-rate conversion
packets will still be accepted with havy traffic, but will be delayed (would be on hold in a circuit switching phone network)
priorities can be used, QoS stuff.


fragmentation can be used to split data into more packets - is faster as more can be trasmitted at the same time (don't have to wait for the whole data to trasmitt to next station)
only to a certain point as the headders on each packet


Telephone

Four generic components of PSTN
* Subscribers - phones
* Subscriber line - link between subscribr and network
* Exchanges - switching centres
* Trunks - branches between exchanges, use FDM or TDM

datagram vs virtual circuit
datagram - each packet is treated indepently. e.g. IP networks
virtual circuit - preplanned route is created before any packets are sent. e.g. ATM (async transfer mode), IP with MPLS

| Issue              | Datagram          | Circuit                                                      |
|:-------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Setup              | No setup required | required                                                     |
| Addressing         |                   |                                                              |
| State Information  |                   |                                                              |
| Routing            | Independently     | Route chosen when VC is setup                                |
| Effect of failure  | No effect         | All VCs that passed through the failed router are terminated |
| Quality of service | Difficult         | Easy if resources can be allocated in advance                |
| Congestion Control | Difficuilt        | Can be allocated for                                         |
	
frequency reuse allows multiple simultaneous conversaions
radio power control allows you to limit the escaping signal to adjacent cells

minimum distance between centres of cells that use the same band of frequencies:
D = sqrt(3*N) * R
N = number of cells in pattern (cluster)
R = radius of hex


ways to increace capacity
* add new channels (increace bandwidth) - usually need to pay for it
* frequency borrowing (cells can borrow frequencies from adjacent cells) - LTE uses this
* cell splitting - split a cell into smaller parts - used in high use areas
* cell sectoring - directional wedge shaped sectors. each cell is assigned a subset of the cells channels
* microcell - small antennas
