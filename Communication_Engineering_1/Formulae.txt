====== Formulae ======
Use tables of integrals & tables of fourier transforms

==== Fourier transform properties: ====
Symmetry - the Fourier transform of a real function will be symmetrical
=== Shift: ===
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
this will change the phase in the f domain
=== Magnitude: ===
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}

==== Power and Energy Signals properites ====
shift and inversion have no effect on the engergy of a signal
when a signal's amplitude is multiplied by k:
E_{kx} = k^{2}E_{x}

=== Convolution - linear time-invariant system ===
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
usually just x(t) and H(f) are given
