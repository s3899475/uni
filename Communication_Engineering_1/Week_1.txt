===== What is communication engineering =====
A primary aim of communication engineering is the reliable transmission of information from a transmitter, through a channel to a receiver
The information can be represented as a function of time, called a signal

Three major subsections:
* communication networks
* communication systems
* communication devices

==== Networks ====
an interconnected group of nodes
communication network engineering deals with the control, transfer, switching, and/or routing of information (traffic) between nodes.
Examples:
* PSTN (telephone network)
* Mobile phones
* Internet
* LANs

==== Systems ====
a physical transmission link that allows the trasfer of information from one point to the other
networks are made up of multiple communication systems (e.g. ethernat cables)
systems can be charactarised by transmission media:
* Twisted pair/coax
* Wireless (air)
* optical fiber

==== Devices ====
a physical component that provides some sore of communication function
systems contain many communication devices
examples:
* Antenna
* DSP devices
* Laser diode (used for optical fibre)
* Modulator
* Multiplexer - squeeze signals into one medium

===== Review of Transforms =====
**Fourier Transform:** transformation from time domain to the frequency domain
**Laplace Transformation:** transformation from the time domain into the generalised (complex) frequency domain. used in system analysis

**Spectrum:** the fourier transformation of a signal, describes the frequency spectrum
**Fourier series:** a specific representation that is used **only** for **periodic** signals

==== Fourier Series ====
periodic signals can be represented by the sum of sinusoids and/or cosines.
the Fourier series is used to decompose these periodic time signals into their sine and cosing components
The frequencies of these functions are multiples of the fundamentals frequency of the signal, f0 = 1/T0
to completely replicate some signals, e.g. a square wave, an infinite number of sinusoids are needed

The Fourier series can be represented in either trigonometric or exponential (complex) forms.
== The trigonometric Fourier series ==
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
where
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
T0 is the period of the function
a0 is the dc offset
ak is the weightings of cosines
bk is the weighting of sines
ω0 is the radian frequency, which is the fundamental frequency. k is the multiples of this frequency

== The exponential (complex) fourier series ==

==== The Fourier Transform ====
FT is normaly defined as the Fourier Transform pair since the time signal can be obtained from the frequency spectrum by the inverse transformation
The Fourier Transform can also be used on aperiodic signals
Frequency Domain:
{{./equation010.png?type=equation}}
Time Domain (inverse Fourier Transform):
{{./equation011.png?type=equation}}

information from fourier transform:
* frequency content (spectrum), or
* If we transform the impulse response, we will get the behavour of a system to different frequencies, known as its **frequency response**

The output of a real time signal is generally complex
The allows you to get information about the magnitude (|X(f)|) and phase ∠X(f)
Normally plotted as two graphs, magnitude vs. frequency and phase vs frequency(f)

=== Properties of the Fourier transform ===
* duality - pulse in time domain = sink in freq domain, sink in time domain = pulse in freq domain
* flip - flipping a signal in time domain
* scaling - wider in time domain = narrower in freq domain
* time-shift and freq-shift. Shift in phase will introduce a complex exponential
* **modulation**
multiplying a signal by a cosine will split the spectra into two, with each amplitude at half the original
one copy will be centered arround f0 and the other arround -f0
where f0 is the frequency of the cosine

==== The Laplace Transform ====
It is a generalisation of the Fourier transform
It is useful in solving linear ordinary differential equaltions, sych as those arising in the analysis of electronic circuits (RC and RL circuits).
It is the main tool in analysing analogue (continuous-time) feedback systems where stability is of extreme importance. I.e. finding poles and zeroes, working out whether the system is stable/unstable and if it tends to infinity or convergest to a value

To S Domain
{{./equation013.png?type=equation}}
To Time Domain (inverse laplace transform)
{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}

==== Sampling property ====
{{./equation015.png?type=equation}}
the delta function samples x at time 0. The output is scaled by the value of x at t=0
{{./equation016.png?type=equation}}
the delta function has a magnitude of 1 across all frequencies. i.e. FT(δ(t)) = 1

=== Normalized sinc function ===
{{./equation017.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation018.png?type=equation}}

==== Laplace examples ====
{{./equation019.png?type=equation}}
integral of a function gets transformed into 1/s
{{./equation020.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation021.png?type=equation}}

==== Transfer functions and stability ====
{{./equation022.png?type=equation}}
poles = denominator = when it will fo to inf?, will determine stability
zeroes = numerator = when it will go to 0

zeroes = 0, -1
poles = -2, -2, -3
{{./pasted_image006.png}}
poles are x
zeroes are circles

in z domain, if poles are outside unit circle, system is unstable. On unit circle is marginally stable
in s domain, if poles are on the right side of the plane (σ > 0) the system is unstable
