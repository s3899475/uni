===== Tutorial =====
y(t) = sinc(100t)
fourier transform is a block from -50 to 50  hz, height = 1/L = 1/100
min. sampling rate = 2 * 50 Hz = 100 samp/sec

y(t) = sinc^{2}(100t)
Y(f) = 1/100Δ_{2×100}(f) 
Fourier transform is triangle from -100 to 100 Hz
min. sampling rate = 2*100 Hz = 200 samp/sec

y(t) = sinc(100t) + sinc(50t)
min. sampling rate is the max of both
min. sampling rate = 2*50 Hz = 100 samp/sec

PAM = (quantisized) amplitude levels
PCM = Binary number from PAM, choose number of bits (e.g. 4 bits = 16 discrete levels)

==== Q2 ====
100,000 ascii code (128 characters)
128 = 2^{7} = 7 bits per character (or per symbol)

bits per second = 100,000 * 7 = 700,000 bps

min bandwidth
when a peice of information is a bit and using sinc shape(ideal, theoretical):
	channel can transmit 2 pieces of information per second per Hz - bandwidth will be half of bitrate
	In an ideal situation
700,000 / 2 = 350,000 Hz

If a parity bit is added, there will be 8 bits per character
bitrate = 800,000 bps
min. samp freq = 400,000 Hz

==== Q3 ====
analogue signal converted into a PCM signal that is transmitted using a square-shaped polar Non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line-code. The signal is transmitted over a channel that is absolutely bandwidth limited to 4 kHz. Assume the PCM quantiser has 16 levels

max PCM bit-rate
bitrate = bandwidth
bitrate = 4 kpbs

max bandwidth of original analogue signal
number of bits in each level = log2(16) = 4 bits per symbol
bitrate / bits per symbol = 4000/4 = 1000 symbols (sampling rate)
fs = 2B → B = fs/2
bandwidth = 1000/2 = 500 Hz


repeat with raised cosine, r=0.5
bit-rate
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
Rb = 2*4kHz / (1+0.5)
bitrate = 5333.3 bps

max bandwidth of original analogue signal
5333.3 / 4 = 1333.3 sampling rate
bandwidth = 1333.3 / 2 = 666.7

=== Line codes ===
NRZ - signal does not return to zero, is held to voltage level during entire bit period
square wave
Bt = Rb
bandwidth = bitrate

Raised cosine
slightly smoothed square wave

r = rolloff factor

===== Lab 3p1 =====
message freq = 8 kHz
Gain of message = 1V

Frequency of carrier = 100 kHz
frequency deviation = W/2 - B
= 60/2 - 8 = 22 kHz
