====== Midsem test ======

===== Q1) =====
The two mistakes that Bob has made are:
1)
The bandwidth will be 10 kHz for a double sideband amplitude modulated message of 5 kHz
This violates the bandwidth requirement of 9 kHz
2)
The message amplitude |M| will at times be too high, as the maximum amplitude of 2cos(10,000π t) is 2
This does not conform with the requirement of |M| ≤ 1

===== Q2) =====
Bob is currently trying to use a suppressed carrier (SC) signal with an envelope detector.
The reason this does not work is that an envelope detector will only detect the correct signal if the envelope (message) is entirely above the y axis. If it is not, the portion below the y axis will interfere with it.
Another way to explain it is that the modulation index, β, must be less than or equal to 1. With a suppressed carrier signal, the modulation index is effectively infinite.

The changes that Bob could make to fix the problem are either:
1) transmitter end
Bob could add the carrier signal to the modulated system output y(t)
This would change the signal to an additive carrier AM signal, which could be correctly demodulated by an envelope detector

2) receiver end
Bob could change the envelope demodulator to a synchronus demodulator
This would work because synchronous demodulators are able to demodulate suppressed carrier AM signals, through the use of a local oscillator set at the right carrier frequency.


===== Q3) =====
Frequency deviation of Kevin's signal
max voltage = 1V
Δω = Kω × m(t)_max = 140,000π × 1V
Δω = 140,000π rad/sec
Δf = Δω / (2π) = 70,000 Hz

Bandwidth of Kevin's signal:
Using Carson's rule:
W = 2Δf + Bm
W = 2×70,000 + 15,000
W = 155,000 Hz

Since the bandwidth (W) is below 200,000 Hz, this fulfils the bandwidth requirement
The frequency deviation is below 75,000 Hz, so the frequency deviation requirement is fulfilled.
The message's bandwidth is acceptable as it is equal to the upper limit of 15,000 Hz

===== Q4) =====
The input of the superheterodyne receiver is an amplitude modulated signal. This signal is initially amplified to improve the signal strength.
The mixer modulates the incoming 100.3Mhz signal with the local oscillator signal, which splits the frequency of it around 111 MHz. The output equation of the mixer is as follows:
r(t) = A_c [1 + m(t)].cos((ω_c + ω_LO)t) + A_c [1 + m(t)].cos(|ω_c - ω_LO|t)
This will produce two harmonics, centred around the following frequencies:
(ω_c + ω_LO) = 100.3 Mhz + 111 Mhz = 211.3 Mhz
|ω_c - ω_LO| = |100.3 Mhz - 111 Mhz| = 10.7 Mhz
The signal is again amplified at this stage to increase its strength.
Only one of these frequencies is the correct intermediate frequency, so the bandpass filter (BPF) is used to filter the other frequency out.
The intermediate frequency signal will then be demodulated to recover the message signal.
The message signal is sent through a final amplifier to raise its volume, and then sent to the speaker to be transformed into a sound signal.
