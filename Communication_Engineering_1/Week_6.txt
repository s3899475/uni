===== Part 1 - Review of Sampling Theory =====
=== Why sample? ===
most naturally occurring signals are analogue (e.g. audio, temperature, EEG, ECG)
If we want to process this information using computers or store the information on a computer we need this data in digital format.
To achieve this we utilize a process of signal sampling (discrete time) together with quantisation (discrete amplitude) and binary encoding to create digital signals to be processed/stored on computers/DSPs

==== Ideal Uniform Sampling ====
sampling is the process of taking discrete instances from an analogue signal at a uniform rate called the **sampling rate/frequency, f_{s}**

This is achieved by multiplying a train of impulses with the analogue signal, x(t)

impulses spaces T_{s} seconds apart

In the frequency domain, sampling gives the original signal's spectrum repeated infinitely every f_{s} Hz (called aliases)

==== Nyquist's Criteria ====
Sampling and reconstructing a signal can only be successful these are fulfilled

1. For a signal with single-sided bandwidth, W, a sampling rate of **f_{s} > 2W** must be used to avoid aliasing
2. The reconstruction filter needs to be designed to have a cutoff frequency f_{c} of: **f_{c} = f_{s}/2**. This will remove aliases

Due to thees rules (and aliasing) the digital equivalent of infinity is f_{s}/2, everything above this is a spectral repetition (alias) and can be disregarded

If Nyquist's criteria are not fulfilled a digitised signal will not be able to be reconstructed accurately when it is converted back to an analogue signal.

This is called **alias distortion** and is due to not enough samples being taken of a signal to accurately represent it or a filter allowing aliases to pass through at reconstruction

=== Time Domain alias distortion ===

The red lines are the estimate this system makes of the original signal.
The bottom graph does not contain enough samples to make an accurate estimate of the correct frequency

=== Frequency Domain alias distortion ===

using a chirp signal

alias distortion causes overlap of the repeated spectral components in the freqency domain.
This means that the reconstruction filter cannot discriminate between the original spectra and the aliases
