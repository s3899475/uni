Analogue is the foundation for DSP
all wireless transmissions are analogue signals
	Antennas cannot transmit digital signals directly
	Transmission generally requires analogue modulation/multiplexing techniques

==== Modulation ====
Involves two signal components:
* A **modulating signal** — the message m(t) or baseband signal
* A **carrier** — a high frequency sinusoid

When a signal is modulated, the carrier's **amplitude**, **frequency**, or **phase** is then varied in proportion to the baseband signal m(t)

=== Why Modulate? ===
== To enable wireless transmission of a baseband signal ==
* **Efficient** wireless transmission requires an antenna at least λ/4 long (quatre-wavelength monopole antenna), or multiples of this value
* Human hearing is from 20Hz to 20kHz, which are large wavelengths, antennas would need to be prohibitively large to transmit these frequencies

{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
antenna length for 20Hz = 3,750 km!
antenna length for 500MHz = 15 cm
much more practical

== To allow multiple signals to be transmitted through the air ==
Signals can be changed to different frequencies, so that many messages can be transmitted at once - transmitting at baseband would interfere with each other
called Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
used in AM and FM radio

===== Amplitude Modulation =====
alters the amplitude of a carrier signal proportionally to the amplitude of an information signal, m(t)

=== Generating Equation ===
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
== m(t) has its own amplitude!! ==
Ka = amplitude sensitivity, dictates how far the amplitude of the carrier will change
[1 + m(t)] — 1 = just carrier signal, m(t) = message
so, [1 + m(t)]c(t) = carrier + carrier*message

The information signal will decide the **envelope** (instantaneous amplitude) of the modulated signal
The sinusoidal carrier will decide the **centre frequency** of the modulated signal

=== AM - Time Domain ===

=== AM - Frequency Domain ===
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
The middle spike at the bottom is the original carrier signal, the spikes to the side are the message signal that has been modulated

=== Double Side Band AM (DSB AM) ===
used for commercial broadcasting
Also called conventional AM
Called double side-band since the negative part of the information spectrum now appears in the positive part of the spectrum, centred around f_{c} Hz

== Bandwidth of DSB AM ==
need a channel with a bandwidth of at least 2B Hz
Thsi is because the negative side of the message spectrum now appears in the positive frequency domain
{{./pasted_image002.png}}

== Power of DSB AM ==
Power of carrier (sinusoid)
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}

Power of message
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

Power of DSB AM:
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
Most of the power will come from the carrier

=== Modulation Index (β) ===
The ratio of message to carrier is the **modulation index**, β
Is affected by he value selected for sensitivity, as well as the carrier and message amplitudes (Ac and Am)
== For y(t) = A_{c}[1+K_{a}m(t)].cos(ω_{c}t) ==
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
== m(t) has its own amplitude!! = A_{m} ==

A higher modulation index can make the signal cleared when it is demodulated, as it will have more power
To avoid over-modulation, the combination of message amplitude and amplitude sensitivite, K_{a}, cannot be too large

The modulation index, β **must be less than 1**
If this is not fulfilled, the AM signal's **envelope** will not be able to represent the original information.
== When β < 1, this is called under-modulation ==
In broadcasting, the practical value of the modulation index ranges between 0.8 and 0.9
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
When the modulation index is > 1, the upper and lower envelope will overlap, which can be harder to demodulate. This will cause distortion in audio

==== Suppressed Carrier (SC) AM - DSB and SSB ====
used in niche area
=== Double sideband suppressed carrier AM (DSB/SC) ===
Direct modulation. No Additive carrier term
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
{{./pasted_image004.png}}

{{./pasted_image005.png}}{{./pasted_image007.png}}
No big spike at f_{c} in frequency spectrum

== Properties: ==
* More efficient power consumption
* Modulation index undefined/infinity
* More complex, synchronous detection techniques required to demodulate
	* Usually uses a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) – Synchronises the phase of a local carrier to the phase of the carrier used to transmit the signal
**Power:**
carrier:

**DSB/SC AM Power:**
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}


=== Single sideband suppressed carrier AM (SSB/SC) ===
No additive carrier (SC)
remove a sideband - redundant information
	Half the bandwidth of DSB – Improved bandwidth efficiency
{{./pasted_image008.png}}{{./pasted_image009.png}}
Only the upper sideband is present in the final spectrum

== Signal equation ==
