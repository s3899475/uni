====== Week 9 - Introduction to Optical Fibres ======

===== Part 1 - What is an optical fibre? =====
Optical fibres are widely used in telecoms, used in NBN (FFTN, FTTP)

{{./pasted_image.png?height=600}}
Optical fibre spectrum range
close to the visible range - **near-infrared**
 - commonly operate in the near-infrared range (800 nm - 1600 nm), just outside the longest visible wavelength for human vision

==== Information Capacity ====
The frequency determines the amount of information that can be transmitted.
In theory, the higher the carrier frequency, the greater the transmission bandwidth and information carrying capacity
* Bandwidth for communication systems is typically 5-10% of the carrier frequency

Optical frequencies offer an increase in potential usable bandwidth in Hz of ~10,000 over microwave frequencies
 - huge increase in information capacity

==== Light - properties ====
Light is an electromagnetic (EM) wave with both an elevtric field and magnetic field components at right angles to each other.
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
velocity (v)
frequency (f)
wavelength (λ)

The velocity of light depends on the medium through which it is propagated. This defines the **refractive index** of the medium.
The speed of light in free space (in a vaccum) is
c = 3×10^{8} m/s

=== Refractive Index ===
defined as:
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
or v = c/n
n cannot be below 1

The **higher** the refractive index, the slower the light travels
For glass n ≈ 1.5 and hence the velocity of light in glass is:
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
When light enters glass its wavelength shortens because its velocity decreases.
The frequency of the light **does not change**

==== What is an Optical Fibre ====
An optical fibre consists of:
* A cylindrical guiding region called the **core**, with a refractive index n_{co}, which may have a **step-index** or **graded-index** profile.
* A surrounding layer with a smaller refractive index n_{cl}, known as the **cladding**
* A coloured plastic jacket for protection and identification

both the cladding and core are made of glass
Optical fibres are usually made of low-loss **silica glass** with small amounts of doping material to change the refractive index. 

{{./pasted_image002.png}}

=== Optical Fibre Geometry - step-index vs graded-index ===
The **refractive index profiles** below show how the refractive index varies within the core of an optical fibre. The fibre core has a diameter of 2a
* A **step-index** core has a constant refractive index throughout the core which is higher than the refractive index of the cladding
* a **graded-index core** has a refractive index which gradually deceases from n_{co} to n_{cl} as the distance from the fibre axis increases.


{{./pasted_image003.png}}

=== Optical Fibre Dimensions ===
Typical dimensions are:
|                   | Multimode Fibre | Single-mode Fibre |
|:------------------|:----------------|:------------------|
| Core diameter     | 50-62.5 µm      | 8-10 µm           |
| Cladding diameter | 125 µm          | 125 µm            |
| Plastic jacket    | 250 µm          | 250 µm            |

{{./pasted_image004.png?width=800}}

==== Refraction ====
When a ray of light passes from a medium of **lowe**r refractive index into a medium of **higher** refractive index:
* It passes directly through if it is **normal** (perpendicular) to the boundary
* If it approaches the boundary at an angle, it is bent **towards** the normal. This is called **refraction**
{{./pasted_image005.png?width=800}}

In **reverse** (from a **higher** refractive index medium to a **lower** refractive index medium), light is bent **away** from the normal, up to a point called the **critical angle**, after which the interface acts like a mirror.

{{./pasted_image006.png?width=800}}

==== Snell's Law ====
Refraction at an interface is governed by **snell's law**:
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
{{./pasted_image007.png?width=800}}
A fraction of the light is reflected

We can rewrite snell's law as:
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
If n_{1} > n_{2} then θ_{2} > θ_{1}

When θ_{2} = π/2 then θ_{1} = **critical angle**, θ_{c}
 - therefore sin(θ_{c}) = n_{2}/n_{1}

If θ_{1} > θ_{c}, **total internal reflection occurs**
 - This is the mechanism by which light can travel down an optical fibre

=== Total Internal Reflection ===
{{./pasted_image008.png?width=800}}
Ray A undergoes **total internal reflection**
Ray B undergoes **partial reflection** and **partial transmission** at the air/glass interface
 - loss of power occurs

==== Light Propagation in Optical Fibres ====
In an optical fibre light **propagates** or travels via a series of multiple internal reflections if θ_{1} > θ_{2} at the interface between the core and cladding regions
{{./pasted_image009.png?width=800}} 
φ = 90° - θ_{1} because the lines are perpendicular

==== Modes ====
Rays of light won't propagate at all angles in a fibre, even if θ_{1}>θ_{c}
Only rays whose total phase shift over successive zig-zags is an integer multiple of 2π radians can propagate.
These ray paths are called **modes**
{{./pasted_image010.png?width=800}}

The blue ray path corresponds to the **fundamental** or **lowest order mode** and travels almost straight down the fibre axis.
The purple and green ray paths are **higher order modes**

== larger code diameter = more possible modes ==


===== Part 2 - Optical Fibre characteristics =====
==== Types of Optical Fibre ====
=== Step-Index Single-Mode Fibres ===
{{./pasted_image011.png?width=800}}
The refractive index of the core is **uniform** in step-index fibres. There is an abrupt decrease in refractive index at the boundary between the core and cladding regions
Only **one mode** can propagate down this type of fibre
Core diameter is very small

=== Step-Index Multimode Optical Fibres ===
{{./pasted_image012.png?width=800}}
Again the refractive index of the core is uniform and has an abrupt decrease at the core/cladding boundary
With these fibres many modes can propagate down the fibre using the laws of total internal reflection
Core diameter is relatively large

=== Graded-Index Multimode Optical Fibres ===
{{./pasted_image013.png?width=800}}
Graded-index fibres have a **non-uniform refractive index** throughout the core; the refractive index gradually decreases with distance from the centre of the core
Many modes can propagate, but note the way the ray bends almost sinusoidally rather than zig-zags throughout the medium
modes = amplitudes of the sinusoids

==== Acceptance Angle ====
For a ray of light to be transmitted by total internal reflection within the fibre core, it must be incident on the core within an acceptance cone defined by and **acceptance angle, θ_{a}**_{.}
{{./pasted_image014.png?width=800}}
θ_{a} is the maximum angle to the fibre axis that light may enter the fibre in order to propagate - refraction + limit of total internal reflection
=== Example Calculation ===
By Snell's Law:
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
Since θ_{c} is the critical angle, sin(θ_{c}) = n_{cl}/n_{co} and hence,
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
Therefore,
{{./equation007.png?type=equation}}

== Acceptance Angle Formula ==
{{./equation008.png?type=equation}}
where n_{0} is the refractive index of the material outside the fibre. For air in front of the fibre, n_{0}=1

==== Numerical Aperture ====
A measurement of an optical fibre's light gathering ability
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}
For optical fibres used in telecommunications, the difference between n_{co} and n_{cl} is very small (<1%), and the NA is typically 0.1 < NA < 0.3

==== V Parameter ====
used to characterise the guiding properties of an optical fibre - determine multimode or single-mode
{{./equation010.png?type=equation}}
where λ is the wavelength of the guided light and a is the radius of the core

Optical fibres with V » 1 have many possible ray paths (typically hundreds). These fibres are known as **multimode optical fibres**
Optical fibres with V < 2.4 allow only a single ray path. These fibres are known as **single-mode optical fibres**

===== Part 3 - Components of an optical fibre communication system =====
{{./pasted_image001.png?width=800}}
==== Optical Fibre ====
Discussed above

==== Optical Sources ====
Convert electrical energy in the form of a current into optical energy (light)
The optical sources used in optical fibre communication systems are typically **semiconductor laser diodes (LSs)**
 - Allow for good frequency control
 - Typically forward biased p-n junction diodes formed in III-V compound semiconductor materials
   - not silicon - group 3-5 of periodic table

=== Optical Absorption and Emission ===
For emission and absorption of light, the particle theory of light is used
The particle or quantum theory regards light as consisting of **photons** - discrete packets of energy
The energy of a photon of light at a frequency f, is:
{{./equation011.png?type=equation}}
Where h is **Planck's constant**, h = 6.624 × 10^{-34} Joules×Seconds

The equation can also be expressed with electron volts (eV):
{{./equation012.png?type=equation}}
1 eV = 1 Joule / 1.6×10^{-19}

The processes of **optical absorption** and **optical emission** arise from electron transitions between atomic energy levels.
The frequency or wavelength of absorbed or emitted light is related to the energy difference between the energy levels. This relationship can be written as:
{{./equation013.png?type=equation}}

Three processes of interest are:
* absorption
* spontaneous emission
* stimulated emission
 
{{./pasted_image015.png?width=800}}
E_{i} - energy level of the electron

Spontaneous Emission → **Incoherent Radiation**
* Light is emitted by random transitions from a large number of atoms. Frequency and wavelength can vary
Stimulated Emission → **Coherent Radiation**
* Each emitted photon has the same energy as the incident photon which caused it and therefore the light associated with it has the same frequency and wavelength.
* Light associated with the stimulating and stimulated photons is in phase and has the same polarisation (electric and magnetic field orientation)
* Optical waves of both photons add in a constructive manner, providing optical amplification

=== Semiconductor Light Sources ===
Laser Diodes (LDs) and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are formed using III-V compound semiconductor materials.
The wavelength emitted by a laser diode (or LED) depends on the composition of the semiconductor material.
* Aluminium Gallium Asenide (AlGaAs) compounds are used for wavelengths in the 800-900 nm range
* Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (InGaAsP) compounds are used for the longer wavelengths of interest in the 1300-1600 nm range

==== Laser Diodes (LDs) ====
make use of coherent stimulated emission
* emit high power (typically 1-20 mW or more)
* exhibit a narrow spectral linewidth (range of wavelengths present), equivalent to spectral bandwidth (range of frequencies present)
	* 1-5 nm for multimode laser diodes
	* < 1 nm for single-mode laser diodes
* emit with a small, highly asymmetric beamwidth (making it easy to couple to a fibre)
	* light is in a tightly directed beam

=== Fabry-Perot (FP) Laser Diode ===
The simplest form of laser diode
consists of a short Fabry-Perot **optical cavity** fabricated with partially reflecting mirrors.
Current injected through the **forward biased** p-n junction results in the emission of photons.
* electrons and holes recombine and generate photons
* lasing occurs above a certain threshold current when the **optical gain** in the cavity equals the **optical losses** in and from the cavity
	* build up of photons occurs

{{./pasted_image017.png}}

=== L-I Curve ===
The light output power versus current characteristic (L-I curve) of a typical laser diode is shown below
{{./pasted_image018.png}}
Below the **lasing threshold current** (I_{th}) the optical output is purely due to spontaneous emission (same as LEDs)
Lasing occurs for currents above I_{th} due to stimulated emission and the optical output increases rapidly
power is directly relational to the current

=== Spectrum of a Fabry-Perot LD ===
The reflecting ends of the F-P cavity provide optical feedback and **constructive interference** for certain wavelengths
Lasing occurs for wavelengths such that the cavity length (L) is a multiple of a half-wavelength
{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}
where λ_{0} is the free-space wavelength, n is the refractive index of the semiconductor material and m is an integer.

The laser output consists of a number of narrow spectral lines called **longitudinal modes**
The spacing of longitudinal modes is:
{{./equation015.png?type=equation}}

== Fabry-Perot laser diodes are multimode lasers ==
A pulse of light emitted by a Favry-Perot laser diode contains many wavelengths (longitudinal modes)
 - This can lead to large pulse broadening in an optical fibre
 - explored later, because different wavelengths have different speeds in the fibre

The spectral linewidth is typically defined as the **full-width at half maximum (FWHM)** spectral bandwidth
{{./pasted_image019.png}}

=== Single-Mode Laser Diodes ===
most high bit rate optical fibre communications systems use single-mode laser diodes to minimise the effects of chromatic dispersion in single-mode optical fibre
Single-mode laser diodes use grating structures in the cavity to provide strong optical feedback and lasing at a single wavelength
**Distributed Feedback (DFB)** laser diodes are the most important single-mode laser diode at wavelengths of 1300-1600 nm
 - spectral linewidths are < 0.1 nm

{{./pasted_image020.png}}
{{./pasted_image021.png}}

==== Modulation Formats ====
The electrical signal which modulates an optical carrier can be either an analogue or a digital signal
Since to optical power or optical inteinsity varies in proportion to the drive current of the optical source this type of modulation is called **Intensity Modulation** (IM)
The majority of fibre systems use intensity modulation

=== Analogue Modulation of LDs ===
{{./pasted_image023.png?width=1000}}  

=== Digital Modulation of LDs ===
{{./pasted_image022.png}}
Laser Diodes are usually given a substantial applied bias in the off-state for digital modulation.
The laser is biased near but **just above** the threshold current in the off state because:
* It reduces the switch-on delay
* It allows easy compensation for changes in ambient temperature and device ageing

Although there is some output optical power in the 'off' state, stimulated emission in the 'on' state is much larger, generally by a factor of 10 or more
 - can clearly differentiate zero and ones

==== Optical Detectors ====
=== Photodetectors ===
converts an optical signal to an electrical signal (effectively demodulates the signal)
Basic requirements:
* **Sensitivity** at the required wavelength
* **Efficient conversion** of photons to electrons to product a maximum electrical signal for a given optical power
* **Fast response** since they are required to operate at high frequencies or high bit rates
* **Low noise**

=== Semiconductor Photodiodes ===
In optical fibre systems **semiconductor photodiodes** are used for optical detection
 - these are reverse biased pn-junctions

If an incident **photon's energy (hf)** is greater than the **bandgap energy** of a semiconductor (E_{g}), the photon is absorbed
This causes **electron-hole pairs** to be created in the semiconductor material
 - an electron is excited into the conduction band and a hole is left in the valence band

The bandgap energy is a threshold energy above which the material absorption coefficient increases rapidly
{{./pasted_image024.png?width=1000}}
Ec = conduction band
Ev = valence band

For photon energies less than the bandgap energy, the absorption coefficient of a semiconductor material is zero.

The wavelength corresponding to the bandgap energy is called the **bandedge wavelength**, λ_{g} and is found by:
{{./equation016.png?type=equation}}
Where E_{g} is the bandgap energy in **electron volts (eV)**

A photodiode only responds to wavelengths **less than** λ_{g}
With no incident light, there is a small leakage current in a photodiode which is known as the **dark current**
 - dark current increases with increasing temperature and reverse bias
As the incident light increases, more electrons and holes are generated and the photocurrent increases **linearly** (over many orders of magnitude)

=== Quantum Efficiency and Reponsivity ===
Important parameters of a photodiode
**quantum efficiency (η)** - the efficiency of a photodiode in producing photocarriers (electrons and holes)
* It is the probability that an incident photon will produce an electron-hole pair

**responsivity (R_{0} Amps/Watt)** - the photo**current** produced per unit of incident **optical power**:
{{./equation017.png?type=equation}}

== Example Responsivity of different materials ==
{{./pasted_image026.png?width=800}}

=== PIN Photodiode ===
To maximise the quantum efficiency (and hence responsivity), the photon absorption in the depletion region can be enhanced by placing a very lightly doped **intrinsic** region between the p and n type regions to form a p-i-n structure or an 'PIN' photodiode
== intrinsic = undoped ==
{{./pasted_image025.png?width=800}}
