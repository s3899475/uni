===== Part 1 - Practical Systems for Modulating AM =====
Difficult to generate high voltages in lab (V instead of kV)
kV requires linear power amplifiers which are not very efficient when operating at RF frequencies
High power AM transmission is practically achieved by using several different techniques:
* square-law devices
* switching devices - early type of am modulation
* balance modulators - used for DSB/SC

==== Square Law Device ====
Can be used for modulation as well as demodulation
{{./pasted_image.png}}
non linear
BPF = band pass filter
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
spikes at ±10 Hz are the message
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}

==== Switch Modulators (Switching devices) ====
start my adding carrier and message signals together
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
d(t) is then sampled with a square wave, p_{s}(t) of amplitude V_{0} and frequency equal to that of the carrier
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
Output:
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
effectively imitates the Fourier series, as square waves have infinite harmonics, many AM signals are produced at the harmonic frequencies.
A BPF is needed to isolate the appropriate signal
{{./pasted_image004.png}}
z(t) has infinite harmonics (30Hz, 40Hz, 50Hz, etc)

==== Balanced Modulators ====
used for DSB/SC generation

Combines two AM signals in such a way as to cancel out the carrier components, leaving a double sideband suppressed carrier (DSB/SC) AM signal
This can be changed into a single sideband suppressed carrier s(SSB/SC) AM signal with a band pass filter
{{./pasted_image005.png}}
-1 = -1 multiplication (180° phase change)

{{./pasted_image006.png}}
Carrier (high freq) has 180° phase difference between z1 and z2

===== Part 2 =====
==== Commercial AM radio broadcasting ====
In Australia
AM carrier frequencies: 531 - 1602 kHz with a separation of 9 kHz between channels (2B = 9kHz)
=== Different classes of signal power: ===
* Typically 1-50 kW for local broadcasting
* Up to 0.5 MW for international broadcasting
=== Examples: ===
* 774 ABC Melbourne (national broadcast), power = 50 kW
* 693 3AW Melbourne (commercial broadcast), power = 5 kW
* 855 3CR Melbourne (community broadcast), power = 2 kW
=== Frequency generation ===
AM generation circuits generally don't provide a carrier frequency sufficient for radio transmission
Carrier frequency must be raised using up-converters
Commercially two stages are used:
* Raise carrier to an intermediate frequency (IF) (typically kHz range)
* Then raise carrier to RF frequency (0.53 to 1.6 MHz range)
Amplifiers and BPFs are used after each conversion, as every conversion reduces the carrier power by 1/4x and produces an unwanted image

==== Superheterodyne Receivers ====
Down-convert frequency in a two-step process
{{./pasted_image009.png}}
Single state down-converter receiver
{{./pasted_image010.png}}
Dual stage down-converter

At each mixing stage, harmonics are created from the non-linear nature of the multiplication process
	Hence, a narrow band-filtering is required after each mixing stage
In many practical situations, a dual or even tri-stage down-conversion process is used to further improve the frequency selectivity of the receiver.
	This just means that more mixing stages are added to the receiver with different local oscillator ferquencies and different BPF centre frequencies

=== Example ===
IF = 455 kHz, convert to this frequency
find local osc frequencies that will allow the following radio stations to be demodulated:
* fc1 = 774 kHz
* fc2 = 1026 kHz
* fc3 = 693 kHz
What unwanted harmonics are produced?
Intermediate osc frequencies:
* f_{IF1} = 774 kHz ± 455 kHz = 319 kHz or 1229 kHz
* f_{IF2} = 1026 kHz ± 455 kHz = 571 kHz or 1481 kHz
* f_{IF3} = 693 kHz ± 455 kHz = 184 kHz or 1094 kHz
Mixing process - before BPF:
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
Unwanted harmionics:
f_{IF1} 
774 + 319 = 1091
774 + 1229 = 2001
f_{IF2} 
774 + 571 = 1597
774 + 1481 = 2507
f_{IF3} 
774 + 184 = 931
774 + 1094 = 1841

=== Frequency Selectivity ===
Since mixing produces harmonies, it's possible that interference can occur if a receiver has poor frequency selectivity at its input.
e.g at 693 kHz we would use a local oscillator of 1,148 kHz to produce an IF of |693 - 1148| = 455 kHz
But a station at 1603 kHz could also be detected, since |1,603 - 1,148| = 255 kHz
this is called an **image signal** and it will cause interference

===== Part 3 - Multiplexing =====
Used to allow multiple messages to be transmitted simultaneously through the same channel with no interference
==== Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) ====
used to multiplex multiple (~=24 or 32) telephone calls on a single four-wire cable in both the T-carrier (USA) and E-carrier (Europe) telecommunications standards, respectively
cycles through the different messages, analogous to people speaking at different times
{{./pasted_image012.png}}
TDM is used for messages that have been **encoded as pulses**, e.g. pulse amplitude (PAM) or pulse code (PCM) modulated signals.
**synchronisation** is highly important for TDM as multiple messages are being transmitted during different clock cycles.
	In telephone systems that utilise TDM, there are often timeslots allocated for synchronisation buts to be transmitted on.

==== Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) ====
Multiple messages are modulated on different carrier frequencies far enough apart so as to have no spectral overlap
analogous to people speaking with different pitches
{{./pasted_image013.png}}

==== Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) ====
A spread spectrum technique used in 3G telecomunications
multiple users can make phone calls using parts of the same spectral region
Each digitised message is encoded using a fast-rate, pseudo-random code known to both the transmitter and receiver, only the receiver that knows the code can decode the message
analogous to a room of people speaking in different languages. Only people speaking the same language can understand each other, other conversations arround them sound like noise and are ignored

==== Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) ====
Also called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM(A))
Utilised in both 4G and 5G telecommunications
also a spread spectrum technique

allows multiple users to communicate in the same spectral region by allocating multiple, closely spaces, orthogonal sub-carriers to users.
* Each sub-carrier transmits **part of** a conversation/data, the receiver(s) will know which sub-carriers contain the data
* Sub carriers can overlap
analogous to many people having conversations at the same time, but each conversation is spearated by walls (separate rooms)

==== Examples ====
=== Design a TDM system that will accommodate the following sources: ===
* s1 = analogue 2 kHz bandwidth
* s2 = analogue 4 kHz bandwidth
* s3 =analogue 2 kHz bandwidth
Nyquist's theorem: minimum sampling rate = 2B for aliasing to not occur
* f_{s1} = 2 × 2000 = 4000 samples / sec
* f_{s2} = 2 × 4000 = 8000 samples / sec
* f_{s3} = 2 × 2000 = 4000 samples / sec

Multiplexing and clock cycle details
{{./pasted_image014.png}}
red = s1, green = s3, blue = s2
{{./pasted_image015.png}}

=== Design a FDM system that will accommodate the following types of signals: ===
* s1 = Voice signals (approx. 4kHz baseband bandwidth)
* s2 = Video signals (2.5 MHz baseband bandwidth)
Assume AM is the modulation method

Bandwidth usage and carrier spacing:
modulation effectively doubles bandwidth requirements
minimum bandwidth (in practice would be a bit higher):
B_{voice} = 2 × 4 kHz = 8 kHz
{{./pasted_image016.png}}
B_{video} = 2 × 2.5 MHz = 5 MHz
{{./pasted_image017.png}}
