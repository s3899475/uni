====== Week 2 ======

===== Part 1 - Power and Energy Signals =====
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
=== Average normalised power ===
normalised over a 1 Ω resistor, R = 1
== Instantaneous power ==
power dissipated over a 1Ω resistor by a voltage of amplitude x(t)
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
== Instantaneous energy ==
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
where Δt is the amount of time
=== Total normalised energy ===
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
=== Average normalised power ===
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}

==== Power and Energy Signals ====
Signals can be power signals, energy signals or neither
* **Power signals** are signals where the normalised average power is finite and non-zero (i.e. 0 < P < inf)
* A signal is an **energy signal** if its total normalised energy is finite and non-zero (i.e. 0 < E < inf)
* Signals that have both infinite energy and infinite power cannot be classified as either either energy or power signals. E.g. x(t) = e^-t (over all time, including negative)
Power signal requirements
E = inf, P < inf
Energy signal requirements
E < inf, P = 0

==== Parseval's Theorem ====
relates energy and power in signals, in time and frequency domains
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
This means that signal energy/power can be determined in both the time and frequency domains
For sine waves:
{{./equation007.png?type=equation}}
energy signals converge to 0
periodic signals are usually power signals
aperiodic signals are usually energy signals

===== Part 2 - Bandwidth Definitions =====
spectrum and bandwidth are linked
**filter bandwidth** - frequency range that the filter will pass through

**Base band signals** - signals with spectra centred around 0 Hz

signals - types of bandwidth:
**Bandwidth** is based on the positive part of the spectrum, it can be defined in several different ways:
* **Absolute Bandwidth** is the maximum positive frequency minus the minimum positive frequency in a signal
* **Single sided bandwidth** is the absolute bandwidth, but > 0 Hz
* **3-dB (or half-power) bandwidth** contains the part of the spectra whose power falls no less than
	* used in optical fibres & filter pass regions
{{./equation008.png?type=equation}}
in the **power domain** (everything is squared):
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}
on the **dB scale** the range in which no part of the signal is less than -3dB below maximum power
* **First null-bandwidth** is the width of the positive part of the spectrum from the minimum frequency to the first time the power falls to zero (i.e. a null occurs) in the spectrum
	* used in digital part - with things like sinc function, where it becomes 0 at set points

==== Effective bandwidth ====
The spectral region where 95% (or greater in some applications) of the signal power/energy is located
also called essential bandwidth
used to find out where most of the energy of a signal is

=== Energy spectral density ===
{{./equation010.png?type=equation}}

== Effective bandwidth of e^{-at} u(t) ==
{{./equation011.png?type=equation}}
symmetry - take one half of spectra and energy
{{./equation012.png?type=equation}}
expand and take tan of both sides of equation, then solve for B_{eff}
{{./equation013.png?type=equation}}
95% of the signal's energy lies between ± above Hz

===== Part 3 - Wireless Signal Propagation =====
=== Transmitter ===
info source - usually baseband
transducer - change form to electrical - audio, video
modulation - change to useful frequency
can also be transmitted without modulation
=== Receiver ===
demodulate
maybe reduce noise or reduce channel distortion and/or noise
decoding may also occur

wireless transmission requires modulation
radio waves are affected by the same things light waves are: diffraction, reflection, refraction, absorption and destructive/constructive interference
==== Wireless Propagation Methods ====
=== Ground-wave propagation ===
{{./pasted_image.png}}
low frequency signals (< 2MHz or MF band) can bend around the earth and objects
This is used for AM radio to allow long distance reception

=== Ionospheric propagation ===
also called sky-wave propagation
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
Used in the transmission of signals between 2 – 30 MHz (HF band)
It occurs due to changes in the refractive index between different layers of the ionosphere
The ionosphere is made up of four main layers: D, E, F1 and F2. Each has their own effects on radio waves
Is affected by the time of day, because the sun ionises differently at different times of day

follows Snell's Law:
{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}
where phi_r is the reflected angle and phi_i is the incident angle, n is the refractive index

=== Line-of-sight propagation (LoS) ===
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
Used for signals of high frequency (> 30 MHz or VHF band and above)
more directional, less bouncing off atmosphere
radio line of sight is different from visual

LoS, from curvature of the earth
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
Estimation
{{./equation015.png?type=equation}}
where h is the height of the antenna

==== Communication Channel Effects ====
can happen in wired and wireless signals
=== Multipath Scattering ===
Signal can be scattered off objects in the transmission medium (e.g. trees or buildings)
This causes a signal to arrive at a receiver at different times via several different paths - basically echos
can cause ghosting in TV reception - causes multiple ghost images to appear on screen

can be modelled by FIR filters
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
top is the original signal
α is the attenuation in the scattered path
{{./pasted_image004.png}}

=== The Doppler Effect ===
caused by motion of a transmitter and/or receiver
frequencies can appear to change depending whether the transmitter is moving towards or away from a receiver
{{./pasted_image005.png}}

=== Noise ===
many different types
most important - additive white (Gaussian) noise
can be caused by naturally occurring factors such as solar radiation and thermal noise from head sources

== Additive White Noise ==
Has a constant two-sided power spectral density (PSD) for all frequencies
White → includes all frequencies
Theoretically this means infinite noise power. However, in practice all channels are **bandlimited** (they only pass a certain range of frequencies)
Communication systems use BPFs (Band-Pass Filters) to filter out the expected information signal, centred at the carrier frequency, immediately after the RF stage

== Signal-to-Noise Ratio ==
estimation of the received signal-to-noise ratio
SNR = Signal power / Noise power
can also be generated by proximity to other electrical sources
if there is no modulation (e.g. short range), we call the SNR **baseband SNR** (SNR_{B})
