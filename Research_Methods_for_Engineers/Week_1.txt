===== Abstract =====
//Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) Estimation Performance for Satellite Applications in a Multipath Environment with Rician Fading and Spatial Correlation//

== Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) ==
 Angle at which the signal hits the satellite (uplink side)

Angle at which the signal hits the earth station (ES)

//paper provides a framework for modeling the DoA angle in satellite communications with respect to the elevation angle//
== elevation angle ==

//paper evaluates DoA estimation performance using root mean square error (RMSE) measurements for different satellite communication link conditions (uplink and downlink) through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.//
== root mean square error (RMSE) ==

== Monte Carlo simulations ==

//The simulation’s performanceis evaluated by comparing it with the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) performance metric under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions, i.e., thermal noise.//

== Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) ==

== additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) ==

=== Results ===
//The simulation results demonstrate that incorporating a spatial signal correlation model for DoA estimations significantly improves RMSE performance in satellite systems//
