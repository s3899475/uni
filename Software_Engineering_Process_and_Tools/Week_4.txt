====== Week 4 ======

===== Continuous Integration and Delivery =====
release candidates

Antipatterns:
Deployin gSoftware Manually
Deploying to production only after devlopment is complete
Manual conf management of prod env

Problems:
errors can occur when deployments aren't automated
deployment is not repeatable/reliable
deployment must be documented
depend on deployment expert
can't test deployment

CI
all members integrate frequently - validate through automated building and testing

==== Key Practices ====
Single source repo
Automate building
Automated testing
Everyone commits to mainline every day
every commit should build mainline on integration machine
fix broken builds immediately
keep build process fast

==== Maven ====

branch for each feature(user story) - name as such
must test
commit and push often
implement a CI

Tasks
github project board
Title - task title
make issue
desc = user story and acceptance criteria

group tasks into sprints - use time estimation
