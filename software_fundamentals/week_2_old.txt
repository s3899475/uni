use waterfall process if requirements are not goint to change
Incremental - produce a version fast, then change parts of it and make new versions
Spiral - includes risk analysis
RUP - needs expert team members
Agile - most flexible, needs constant user feedback
tyoes of agile
* scrum
* extreme programming - specific to programming, small projects, small group of programming, unit and functional tests
* feature driven development - big and complex projects, small project increments that can be quickly delivered. Longer feedback loops. Roles that may map to orginization's existing roles
